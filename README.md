This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## If you want to clone it...

In the project directory, all you need to do is install the dependencies with npm:
### `npm install`

And then use: 
### `npm start`

To run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### What's this?

This repository was created for a challenge that got me very excited about. The next feature I wanna add to it, is the storage in localStorage for each conversation, and then the login for each user and the connection with [Socket. IO](https://socket.io/).
Please if you have any suggestions don't mind do it to my personal email: ceciliamermoz@gmail.com
